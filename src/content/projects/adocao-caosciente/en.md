## üê∂ About the project

**Conscious Adoption** is a platform developed to **automate the pet adoption process in NGOs**, solving a common problem: the bureaucracy and slow screening and approval of adopters. The proposal is to make this process more fluid, accessible, and organized.

This project was developed as the final work for the course **SSC0536 - Design and Development of Information Systems** at USP, focusing on modern software engineering practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used

The project was developed by a **team of 8 people**, using the following technology stack:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and **NextUI**
- **Backend**: Python with **FastAPI**
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Testing**: Integration and E2E with **Cypress.io**
- **Deployment**: Docker

The system architecture follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**, with a clear separation between layers to facilitate scalability and maintenance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why these technologies?

The technologies were chosen based on:

- Previous team knowledge
- Ease of maintenance
- Scalability potential
- Active community and good market practices

This modern stack allowed for agile and effective prototyping, focusing on user experience and code organization.

## üìö Main learnings

During the project, I served as **Scrum Master** and **backend developer**, which provided me with valuable learning in:

- Leadership and team collaboration
- Agile project management
- Deepening knowledge in modern frameworks and tools
- Practical application of software engineering concepts

## üß† Development experience

This was a project that occupied an entire course at USP. We had the mentorship of an external agent (university partner) who acted as a real client, participating in classes and following the development.

We worked with **bi-weekly sprints** and held one meeting per week: one for progress presentation and another for **demo** delivery.

As a **Scrum Master**, I participated in all meetings alongside the **Product Manager**, mainly acting as a listener, but always trying to contribute with relevant points.

There were challenges: we often estimated and planned beyond what we could deliver, which overloaded the final sprints, especially for me. As not everyone in the group was equally engaged, I ended up taking on various tasks. I made mistakes in the process, but I learned a lot.

Despite the obstacles, we managed to deliver the project. However, it did not fully meet the initial expectations. For this reason, on **April 24, 2024**, I decided to archive it. Today, it serves as a record of learning and growth.

## üîÆ Next steps

Some features remained pending due to the academic deadline. Among the possible next steps are:

- Improving adoption forms
- Refining the approval flow
- Evolving the project as **open source**

I believe the platform has real potential to positively impact the work of NGOs and transform the pet adoption experience.

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply technical knowledge in a socially relevant context, uniting technology and purpose.
