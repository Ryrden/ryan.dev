## üéÆ About the project

This was **my first project with HTML, CSS, and Javascript**, created with the goal of:

- Practicing everything I had just learned in programming
- Challenging myself to build something interactive and functional
- Training **responsiveness, DOM manipulation, and basic game logic**

It was a simple guessing game based on RGB colors, but for me, it represented **a giant step towards autonomy as a developer**. Each line of code was written manually, without frameworks, just based on pure HTML, CSS, and JS.

## üõ†Ô∏è How it was developed

The stack was lean and ideal for the moment:

- **HTML5** for the page structure
- **CSS3** for style and responsiveness
- **Pure Javascript** for game logic and user interactions

I implemented **dark mode**, **visual effects with `box-shadow` and `hover`**, and a structure adaptable to mobile devices with `media queries`.

## üéØ About the game

The idea was simple: display a partially hidden RGB color and challenge the user to guess which value (R, G, or B) was missing. If the player was wrong, the hint would change. If correct, a simple animation showed the victory and a new round could begin.

With this, I practiced:

- **Events with `addEventListener`**
- **DOM manipulation with `querySelector` and `getElementById`**
- **Use of asynchronous functions and promises**
- **Interactive styling with pure JS**

## üì± Responsiveness and Style

I made sure the game worked well on both desktop and mobile. I used **CSS Grid**, effects with `transition` and `transform`, as well as a clear and intuitive interface for anyone to test.

I also implemented **a system of collapses with animations**, creating an interactive section of help and explanations about the game, something that required attention to UX details and usability.

## üí° Learnings

This project taught me more than just syntax:

- How to **think about game logic** and interactivity
- How to make a website **visually pleasing and functional**
- The importance of **dark mode/accessibility**
- And mainly, how gratifying it is to see something of your own **actually working** in the browser
