## üõ†Ô∏è How it was developed

The project followed fundamental steps of **Design Thinking**, going through:

- **Market research**
- **Creating personas**
- **Low, medium, and high-fidelity prototyping**
- **Usability testing**
- **Final website development**

The **frontend** was built with **React** and **Typescript**, using **Material UI** as the component library. The publication was done for free with **GitHub Pages**.

## üöÄ Chosen technologies

- **React**: Popular at the time, with excellent community support.
- **Material UI**: Based on Material Design, which has a strong focus on usability and modern aesthetics.
- **Typescript**: Added to ensure higher quality and maintainability of the code.

## üìö What I learned

- My first **deployment** using GitHub Pages.
- Practical understanding of **responsiveness** and **accessible design**.
- Application of real **usability and UX concepts**, going from theory to practice.

## üß† Development experience

This was the first project where I followed the steps proposed by **Design Thinking** from end to end. From **gathering ideas** and **benchmarking** with sites in the same niche, to creating wireframes and developing the final product.

All coding was done in **React**, and we managed to deliver a visually satisfying and functional result from a UX/UI perspective. On the other hand, the code had some challenges, especially with libraries that didn't offer full support for certain features. One example was the implementation of a form with [**input masking**](https://github.com/Ryrden/SCC-0560-Caaso-Eletroniks/blob/b7db37befe82bc72437c01329ba812ea80a6fee3/src/Pages/Checkout/Checkout.tsx#L4-L5), which required alternative solutions due to the limitations of the chosen library.

Despite these difficulties, nothing seriously compromised the development. On the contrary, it was a great opportunity to learn in practice and deal with real technical limitations.

This project marked me as a developer and was fundamental to reinforce my interest in creating user-focused solutions.

## üîÆ Next steps

- Create a **simulated backend** to transform the project into a more complete e-commerce.
- Map **alternative flows** and **error handling**.
- Include more **usability and accessibility tests**.
- Add **new features** and **interactivity**.

This project was essential to consolidate practical knowledge in UX and modern frontend.
